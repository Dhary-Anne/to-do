# to-do

**General Information**

In this project, I was implement full CRUD capabilities by building a to-do list. The user is able to input their task(s) and add them to the list as well as cross them out or delete them altogether. 

I learned alot building this common project. I was able to put the skills that I have been learning to the test to create something that I could see myself using if I was in need of an app like this. 

The most difficult part of the project for me was traversing the DOM. I had to refresh my memory quite a bit to be able to reach the desired results but by the end of the project, I became fairly comfortable with the most commonly used DOM manipulation techniques and will be able to utilize this moving forward with other, possibly more complex projects
